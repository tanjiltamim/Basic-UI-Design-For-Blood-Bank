Blood donation refers to the process of transfusing blood from a healthy donor to a recipient in need. This process is carried out under the supervision of medical experts. Blood is an essential fluid that flows in our body and keeps our body properly functioning. Blood is transfused to people who lost excessive blood in accidents or due to severe health issues. It is usually collected from a family member or a healthy donor who is willing to donate. There are four blood groups in humans which are A, B, O, and AB. The people with blood group AB are called universal recipients and with O are referred to as universal donors.
